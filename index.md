# 🛠 Featured Projects

## High-Voltage Battery Management System (Southampton University Formula Student Team) 
Carried out research and development for the car’s High Voltage Battery Management System, including voltage, current and temperature measurement circuits, algorithms for ensuring safety and charging and discharging of the battery.
Worked with the **BQ79616 Developmennt Board** 
Specialised in communication protocols between the battery, management system and sensor cells, including CAN interfacing.

## Dashboard development (Southampton University Formula Student Team)
Integrating an LCD screen into the steering wheel fo the car
Designed the schematic for the buck/boost converter
Finished off schematic design for touch-screen module, STM microcontroller and RAM module
Practiced key routing techniques such as length-matching for RAM connections

## Robotic Arm Project
Programmed and controlled servo motors using potentiometer input, allowing for 3 degrees of freedom. 
Developed a servo-operated mechanical claw with a gear mechanism, capable of 180 degrees of motion and the ability to pick up loads of various shapes and sizes. 
Iteratively designed the claw mechanism, creating 5 prototypes to optimize performance and efficiency. 
Integrated user control via operational modes - a 'rest' and 'active' state via button input for improved functionality.
Programmed with an Arduino Uno R3
