# 🛠 Featured Projects

## High-Voltage Battery Management System (Southampton University Formula Student Team)

- Carried out research and development for the car’s High Voltage Battery Management System, including voltage, current and temperature measurement circuits, algorithms for ensuring safety and charging and discharging of the battery.
- Worked with the BQ79616 Development Board.
- Specialised in communication protocols between the battery, management system and sensor cells, including CAN interfacing.

---

## Dashboard Development (Southampton University Formula Student Team)

- Integrating an LCD screen into the steering wheel of the car.
- Designed the schematic for the buck/boost converter.
- Finished schematic design for touch-screen module, STM microcontroller and RAM module.
- Practised key routing techniques such as length-matching for RAM connections.

## Robotic Arm Project

- Programmed and controlled servo motors using potentiometer input, allowing for 3 degrees of freedom.
- Developed a servo-operated mechanical claw with a gear mechanism, capable of 180 degrees of motion and the ability to pick up loads of various shapes and sizes.
- Iteratively designed the claw mechanism, creating five prototypes to optimise performance and efficiency.
- Integrated user control via operational modes — a "rest" and "active" state via button input.
- Programmed with an Arduino Uno R3.

## Autonomous Rover (Year 2 Project)

- Software lead for autonomous rover project, working on LiDAR-based SLAM, motor control and a Bluetooth-based app for debugging.
- Working on Raspberry Pi Pico W and programming in C++.
- Learning SLAM and autonomous navigation algorithms.

## PWM, ADC and PID on a Microcontroller

- Built a low-pass filter circuit.
- Used a 10-bit timer on the ATmega164PA microcontroller (programmed in C) to vary PWM duty cycle and therefore the potential difference across the capacitor.
- Used serial communication via PuTTY to take the desired duty cycle from the user.
- Implemented PID control and tuned constants to allow the desired voltage to be maintained when external noise was applied.

## Wave Generator GUI

- Designed a GUI in Python using Tkinter to display the voltage measured in the LPF circuit.
- Implemented a real-time waveform with the user able to tune PID constants and set a desired set-point voltage in the GUI.
- Integrated this Python GUI with previous C code to allow PID functionality to be visible in the waveform.
